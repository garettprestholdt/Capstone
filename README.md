# Capstone

### Items of Interest:
- **pitch_prediction_draft.qmd** : This is where almost all of the actual analysis of the data is.
- **Capstone_Initial_Exploration.ipynb** : Inital exploration of the raw data from pybaseball scraper. Found columns of interest to my project and put them into the feature_cols.py file for use later.
- **pybaseball_pipeline.ipynb** : Pipeline I can use to get data of a specific pitcher of interest with minimal work.

### I will be cleaning up the all the unnecessary files in the repository as I get closer to finishing.
